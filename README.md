# CertainlySwiftMapKit
This project was built from scratch during the Certainly Swift Meetup on Sept. 19th 2019.

https://www.meetup.com/Certainly-Swift/events/264187618/

It is a MapKit implementation displaying 4 preloaded map pins while also allowing user input of an address.
The user inputted address will then be displayed on the map as a new pin.

User location is also used.
